Primer on Recurrent Neural Networks
===================================

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a recursive map, that at time step :math:`t` combines the state at
:math:`t-1` with the input to construct a new state. In order to formalize this sentence let us define some notation:

  * :math:`u` stands for the input sequence. :math:`u_t` is the frame at position :math:`t` in the sequence of inputs

  * :math:`h` stands for the (hidden) state of the model. :math:`h_t` is the hidden state at step `t`

  * :math:`y` is the output of the model. :math:`y_t` is the output at time step `t`

  * :math:`W_{hh}` is the recurrent weight matrix (that connects the hidden state :math:`h` to itself)

  * :math:`W_{uh}` is the input weight matrix that goes from the input :math:`u` to the hidden state :math:`h`

  * :math:`W_{hy}` is the ouput weight matrix that goes from the hidden state :math:`h` to the ouput layer :math:`y`

  * :math:`b_h` is the hidden state bias 

  * :math:`b_y` is the output layer bias

  * :math:`\sigma_h` is the activation function for the hidden state

  * :math:`\sigma_y` is the activation function for the output layer

The RNN is defined by the following two equations.

.. math::

    h_t = f(u_{t}, h_{t-1}) = \sigma_h(h_{t-1}W_{hh} + u_t W_{uh} + b_h)

    y_t = \sigma_y(h_t W_{hy} + b_y)

The recurrence is started 
from :math:`h_0` (the initial hidden state) which is provided by the practitioner 
or set to zero. At each time step we compute a new state :math:`h_t` and
predict an output for that step :math:`y_t`. Below this is represented as a
diagram:

    :align: center

.. Note::
    The RNN is similar to an MLP, with the exception that we allow
    connections among the hidden units. This changes drastically the model.
    Through these recurrent connections
    the model exhibits ''memory''. A RNN can approximate arbitrarly well any
    dynamical system, compared to a feed-forward neural model that can only
    approximate nonlinear functions.

The model can be used in several ways. One standard approach is to use 
the RNN to transcribe some input sequence into an output sequence. 
This means that the output sequence is of the same length as the input one, 
and at each time step the ouput of the RNN :math:`y_t` is the prediction of
the :math:`t`-th frame of the target sequence. 

Another task could be to classify the possible input sequences into
different categories. One approach is to only consider the output at the end
of the sequence (after the model has seen the whole sequence). If the input 
sequence :math:`u` has :math:`T` steps, then :math:`y_T` could be a softmax 
layer saying in which the category the current sequence falls. 

Training Recurrent Neural Networks
----------------------------------

Several algorithms are available for training recurrent neural networks. 
Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL), Atyia-Paros learning rule are just a 
few example. An interesting different approach which involves using the recurrent neural 
network to construct a random projection has also been proposed under the
name of Reservoir Computing.
